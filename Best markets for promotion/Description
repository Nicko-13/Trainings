Our goal is to identify the two best countries to advertise e-learning courses on programming. Most of them are on the web and mobile development, but some of them also cover other domains like data science, game development, etc. The raw data available here.

We will use data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. The company runs a popular Medium publication, and their survey attracts our potential customers who might be interested in different topics.

Based on the results of the analysis the best markets for advertising are the USA, India, and Canada.
