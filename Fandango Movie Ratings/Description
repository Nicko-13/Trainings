A data journalist named Walt Hickey revealed that the actual rating of movies on Fandango website is lower than star rating. Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the smallest rating is 0 stars and the largest is 5 stars. Here are some examples of Hickey's findings:

The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect;
In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars;
The aim of the project is to identify any changes in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

To achieve the aim we will compare the system's characteristics previous and after Hickey's analysis. We will use graphs of ratings distributions, probability tables, and some descriptive statistics.
